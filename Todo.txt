💾 Recap: How to Use Local Storage (The Modular Way)In the code separation we just performed, we've isolated the Local Storage access into localStorageService.js. This is the best practice!Reading: To get data, you call the appropriate function from your service file (e.g., getPlaylists() or getUserPlayCounts()). Inside that function, it uses localStorage.getItem('KEY') and then converts the resulting JSON string back into a JavaScript object/array using JSON.parse().Writing: To save data, you call a saving function (e.g., savePlaylists()). Inside that function, you first convert your JavaScript object/array into a string using JSON.stringify(), and then save it using localStorage.setItem('KEY', stringData).ActionJavaScript MethodPurposeStore DatalocalStorage.setItem(key, value)Stores a string value under a string key.Retrieve DatalocalStorage.getItem(key)Returns the string value for the key.Use Complex DataJSON.parse() / JSON.stringify()Used to convert objects/arrays to strings and back for storage.By using the functions in localStorageService.js, the rest of your main.js script only has to worry about what data it needs, not how it's stored.

Pc:
Need to make the style for the playlist content on the sidebar to be more user experience Friendly,like make the content small so we can fit more on that container,and when the user have a lot of playlist and more that the container should fit we will add a scroll function to the containers of the sidebar so the user can scroll down to find the playlist that he wants.


The top 5 can be removed to add a new type of content because we arredy have the slidershow to show a good results abbout the top songs.
the new type of content could be a for you or artists that you follow container,this container would load a list of songs (each on a grid style so we can fit more of then) based on the data from the user like, you liked this artist show a list with buttons to load the songs about that artist.

remove the artist container on the sidebar. will decide what to add later.
 
Change the styles of the slidershow so it showcase more information and be better to look at when the user go to seek information on what is trending there.
