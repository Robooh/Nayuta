💾 Recap: How to Use Local Storage (The Modular Way)In the code separation we just performed, we've isolated the Local Storage access into localStorageService.js. This is the best practice!Reading: To get data, you call the appropriate function from your service file (e.g., getPlaylists() or getUserPlayCounts()). Inside that function, it uses localStorage.getItem('KEY') and then converts the resulting JSON string back into a JavaScript object/array using JSON.parse().Writing: To save data, you call a saving function (e.g., savePlaylists()). Inside that function, you first convert your JavaScript object/array into a string using JSON.stringify(), and then save it using localStorage.setItem('KEY', stringData).ActionJavaScript MethodPurposeStore DatalocalStorage.setItem(key, value)Stores a string value under a string key.Retrieve DatalocalStorage.getItem(key)Returns the string value for the key.Use Complex DataJSON.parse() / JSON.stringify()Used to convert objects/arrays to strings and back for storage.By using the functions in localStorageService.js, the rest of your main.js script only has to worry about what data it needs, not how it's stored.
