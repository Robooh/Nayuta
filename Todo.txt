{NEED TO BE CREATED!!!}Add new Player.html page so the user can change to a Music player page focused where it would load all the content of his playlist  on the right section and the music player would go to the main page space so it would be Sidebar(left) Music player,(Song list of his playlist on the right.) with a lot more of options add into this new page.


{}add playlist function so the user can create then.

{}add a + Button on each card on the song list that would pop a card to add to a new playlist or creating one new.

{}when the user clicks on one of his playlist we will, load then on the right side of the player.html file and load all the content need to run the playlist. 

{}We will make the top 5 to be removed when the user clicks on one of the button on the sidebar and load new content on the place of the top 5,for example.

{}if the user clicks on the recent we will change the top 5 to a new list that would show the 5 more recent songs played or we can add the list below the top 5 we can test later.a


Can you take a look at the project files. after this we will workin on our sidebar, what we want to do is a rework on her. Our ideia is to set user interraction with a button to open close the sidebar on both version the mobile and pc version. we want to change the content of the sidebar on the both version as well right now we got a list on the pc version with a lof of itens that dont do nothing, we want to on the pc version to change then to a version where when sidebar is open we will show the full content of the itens and what they are like 'playlist'' with the icon for this and when the sidebar is closed we will only show the itens. and on mobile we want to creat the profile setting of the user on the sidebar insted of showing the icons by default.
