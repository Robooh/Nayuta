Main 1 version Lauch:
For next:
Pc:(update here then)
Try to find a fix so the user dont have to F5 for every update on the localStorage. 


Mobile:
On mobile Remove hover effect insted: improve the button size and always display the full size of the button play,improve Musiclist card size on mobile
Add row effect on vertical line so it make that effect of the card dissapering on the left and right side of the page so the user can scroll to get the right card like a carrolsel of images but insted is a music list.

Fix the size of the Top5 and recent list(they could have the same size of music list style that we will create)

The slidershow is set but the info about the song can be style better. (text align center and font size and color.)

We could add the profile that is set on the right section on the sidebar so the user on mobile can implement then as well

Add more later.
